# HitboxMod
Shows hitboxes in Cult of the Lamb.  
Colors depend on the hitbox type, though this may be inaccurate as I haven't found a way to accurately determine the type.  
Hitboxes update every frame. If you encounter performance issues, you can enable "Performance Mode" in the configuration file.
